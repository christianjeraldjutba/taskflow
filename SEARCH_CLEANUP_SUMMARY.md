3. **Modular Integration** - Can add search incrementally as needed
4. **Clean Architecture** - No legacy search code to interfere with new implementation

## 📝 **Notes**

- **No Breaking Changes** - All core TaskFlow functionality remains intact
- **Clean State** - No search-related code remnants or dead imports
- **Optimized Bundle** - Removed Fuse.js dependency reduces bundle size
- **Future Ready** - Clean foundation for implementing search later

The TaskFlow application is now in a clean state, ready for continued development without any search functionality dependencies! 🎉
